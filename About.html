						<p class = "margin-25">Pizza is unquestionably America's favorite food. Americans eat an average of 350 slices of pizza each second - that's right, each second. When you total up all the pizzas sold in the U.S. each year, it's more than three billion pizzas. The pizza industry commands over $45-billion in sales each year. So youâ€™ve found a huge, growing market. As a Pizza Place Pizza franchise partner, you will have your biggest opportunity to take advantage of that ever-growing pizza market.</p>
						<br>
						<p class = "margin-25">Currently, we have over 40 locations in the Tri-State region of Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana, and growing. Pizza Place has continued to grow in establishments and menu choices since its founding in 2000.</p>
